                    education
                    Our aim is to support each needy child so that they can be stable and happy and also to reach a
                    stage
                    where they are self-sufficient.<br>
                    We aim to provide a safe and secure environment for the children to grow up in. We also focus on
                    enabling each child to come to a true
                    knowledge of God, His Word and to have a personal relationship with Him. We believe that this is the
                    only way that they can be wholesome
                    individuals, at peace with themselves and of use to the society as an upright, humane and
                    responsible

                            are relocted back to relatives or guardians. Some may require tertiary education assistance,
                            depending
                            on their academic performance. Each residential
                            child has a sponsor sourced from Australia, to cater for their needs.</p>
